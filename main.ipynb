What we have tried to do in this book is to make a comparative study of foreign history as well. This. we hope, will not only enable its readers to know about Nepal history but also to compare the contemporary events in other countries and to read the trends in Nepal History and those in the history of other countries.

To make the book more interesting, some pictures are also given. Index forms another worthmentioning feature of the book., Foreigners too, we hope, will find the book informative and interesting, since it gives them a peep into the history of Nepal in context with the Indian, Chinese and European histories. 2 Introduction Like all other countries of the world, Nepal has also its prehistoric period, shrouded i\n",
